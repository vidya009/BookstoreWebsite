### Installation and Usage
-	Install node js by downloading the installable from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
-	Install angular cli using the following command
  `npm install â€“g @angular/cli` 
  For more angular related commands refer `https://cli.angular.io/`

- For backend Springboot java application development Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers is used.
- For database MySQL workbench 8.0 CE is used.
- Start MySQL workbench and log into it using your credentials (same credentials are used in `application.properties` configuration file in java project).
  In this project Java Persistence API (JPA) is used for Object-relational mapping (ORM).
- In Eclipse IDE, Import Java(Spring Boot) project as 'Existing Maven Project'. All the dependencies required for the spring boot java project are specified in `pom.xml` file.     In  `application.properties` configuration file under src/main/resource update your mysql connection username and password. Now right click `EcommerceApplication.java` file     and Run as Java application. This will start bookstore ecommerce application and also create database and tables in Mysql (Refresh schemas in Mysql). To access Rest endpoint     go to `http://localhost:8080/users/get` in your browser.
- Download and open Angular project in Visual Studio Code. Run `ng serve` command in terminal for a dev server. (Run `ng build` to build the project). Navigate to      `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The angular application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
